PDBE - UniProt workshop

ECCB 2018



### Task 1: Do a basic search for calpain proteins

* How many M-calpains are there in the PDB?
* How many known ligands are there?

### Task 2: Do an advanced search for lysozyme (text) with solution NMR data and release data between 2015 and now
* How many entries are there?
* How many biological functions are provided?

### Task 3: Find entry “3bow”
* When was it released?
* What ligand molecules does it have?
* How high the quality of the entry is?
* What is the canonical entry in UniProt related to this PDB entry?


### Task 4: View the entry page for “2kx9”
* What experimental methods was this structure based on?
* Where can you find experimental data for this entry?

### Task 5: Visit the entry “2aqa” and find the molecule page
* What is the topology of chain A like?
* What SCOP domain does it have?
